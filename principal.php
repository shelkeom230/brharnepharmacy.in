                                An unwavering commitment to outstanding education and research in pharmaceutical sciences and technology defines the success of any College. We are now moving into our mission of educating pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists who possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to become leaders in pharmacy and pharmacy-related practice, research and education.<br>
We are initiating a number of initiatives, including aggressively enhancing our infrastructure to support world-class teaching, learning, and research; providing innovative solutions to the Pharmaceutical industry; building solid, lasting relationships with other institutions & industries and playing an important leadership role. We have state-of-the-art infrastructure supporting separate facilities for D. Pharm,  and  B.  Pharm  courses.  An  intimate  relationship  with  the  pharmaceutical industry helps in exposing our students to the solutions to practical problems of industry. We have planned to regularly organize events of national and international stature independently as well as in collaboration with other renowned academic institutes, professional societies, and pharmaceutical industries. Participation in such events will give our students an edge over their competitors and shape their personalities.<br>

We are poised to enter a period of great opportunity, and face our challenges with genuine  talent  and  resolve.  We  are  ready  to  work  even  harder  to  strengthen  our reputation as the place Where Pharmaceutical scientists and technologists Learn and Discover.<br>

We welcome students, who want to make difference in education and in the professional world of pharmaceutical sciences!
