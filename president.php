                                Jai Shree Siddhivinayak Foundation was established in the year 2007 with a social commitment to providing professional, competitive, and industry- relevant  education  to  the  younger  generation  of  rural  and  urban  areas. Globalization and liberalization have changed all the concerns and references. There is a need to reconsider the present education at all its levels and hence it is necessary to deviate from the traditional methods and use new methods and technology for imparting education.<br>
In today’s era of globalization, an organization needs qualified technocrats and managers filled with enthusiasm and a spirit of hard work blended with self-confidence   to   achieve   their   goals.   At   Jai   Shree   Siddhivinayak Foundation’s B. R. Harne College of Engineering and Technology, we have put together the organizational learning and insights gathered over time and combined them with innovative, state-of-the-art delivery mechanisms that will equip the younger generation to take on the challenges both in India and overseas.<br>
The institute has a very special place in my heart. Since 2011, BRHCET has developed excellent infra-structural facilities with well-equipped laboratories  and  an  enriched  library,  which  will  be  updated  regularly.  I believe that in nearby future the institute will produce competent technocrats and managers who will make a significant contribution to the corporate world and industries all over the world.
All the Best & Welcome!
